# Figures and Latex source files for the manuscript

This folder contains the figures and [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/)
sources for the paper building upon the [GJI LaTeX
template](https://academic.oup.com/DocumentLibrary/GJI/gji-latex.zip).

The text is in file `four-phase-inversion.tex`, references are handled by bibtex and
stored in `references.bib`, and the `Makefile` has the commands for building
the PDF (using the build automation tool
[make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software))).

We recommend using *make* to build the PDF because it handles the file
dependencies. This way, the PDF in only regenerated if any of the source or
figure files change.

## Instructions

* Build the `four-phase-inversion.pdf` (all output files are placed in the `output`
  folder):

        make

* Open `four-phase-inversion.pdf` in a PDF viewer (only works on Linux [requires
  `xdg-open`] and Mac):

        make show

* Estimate the number of words in the paper (only counts words in
  `four-phase-inversion.tex`):

        make wc

* Remove all files generated by the build process:

        make clean
