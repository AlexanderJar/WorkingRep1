  abstract = {We present joint inversion approaches for integrating controlled source electromagnetic data and seismic full-waveform data for geophysical applications. The first approach is the joint petrophysical inversion carried out by reconstructing petrophysical parameters such as porosity and saturations instead of the usual geophysical parameters such as resistivity, seismic velocities and mass density. This approach utilizes the strong correlation between the electromagnetic and seismic parameters through the petrophysical relationships. Another approach that does not require the a priori petrophysical correlation is the joint structural inversion method. In this approach, the inversion is carried out by employing a regularization function for enforcing the structural similarity between the resistivity and the seismic velocities and the mass density. In this method, we employ the cross-gradient function, which has been shown on many occasions to be quite effective. By using a time-lapse reservoir monitoring example, we show that both joint inversion approaches produce results that are superior to those obtained by disjointed inversions. Hence, these joint inversions have great potential to be the next-generation tools for reservoir characterization and monitoring.},

  abstract = {Detailed knowledge of the material properties and internal structures of frozen ground is one of the prerequisites in many permafrost studies. In the absence of direct evidence, such as in-situ borehole measurements, geophysical methods are an increasingly interesting option for obtaining subsurface information on various spatial and temporal scales. The indirect nature of geophysical soundings requires a relation between the measured variables (e.g. electrical resistivity, seismic velocity) and the actual subsurface constituents (rock, water, air, ice). In this work, we present a model which provides estimates of the volumetric fractions of these four constituents from tomographic electrical and seismic images. The model is tested using geophysical data sets from two rock glaciers in the Swiss Alps, where ground truth information in form of borehole data is available. First results confirm the applicability of the so-called 4-phase model, which allows to quantify the contributions of ice-, water- and air within permafrost areas as well as detecting solid bedrock. Apart from a similarly thick active layer with enhanced air content for both rock glaciers, the two case studies revealed a heterogeneous distribution of ice and unfrozen water within Muragl rock glacier, where bedrock was detected at depths of 20-25 m, but a comparatively homogeneous ice body with only minor heterogeneities within Murt l rock glacier. 2011 Author(s).},

  abstract  = {Joint inversion strategies for geophysical data have become increasingly popular as they allow for the efficient combination of complementary information from different data sets. The algorithm used for the joint inversion needs to be flexible in its description of the subsurface so as to be able to handle the diverse nature of the data. Hence, joint inversion schemes are needed that 1) adequately balance data from the different methods, 2) have stable convergence behavior, 3) consider the different resolution power of the methods used and 4) link the parameter models in a way that they are suited for a wide range of applications. Here, we combine active source seismic P-wave tomography, gravity and magnetotelluric (MT) data in a petrophysical joint inversion that accounts for these issues. Data from the different methods are inverted separately but are linked through constraints accounting for parameter relationships. An advantage of performing the inversions separately is that no relative weighting between the data sets is required. To avoid perturbing the convergence behavior of the inversions by the coupling, the strengths of the constraints are readjusted at each iteration. The criterion we use to control the adaption of the coupling strengths is based on variations in the objective functions of the individual inversions from one to the next iteration. Adaption of the coupling strengths makes the joint inversion scheme also applicable to subsurface conditions, where assumed relationships are not valid everywhere, because the individual inversions decouple if it is not possible to reach adequately low data misfits for the made assumptions. In addition, the coupling constraints depend on the relative resolutions of the methods, which leads to an improved convergence behavior of the joint inversion. Another benefit of the proposed scheme is that structural information can easily be incorporated in the petrophysical joint inversion (no additional terms are added in the objective functions) by using mutually controlled structural weights for the smoothing constraints. We test our scheme using data generated from a synthetic 2-D sub-basalt model. We observe that the adaption of the coupling strengths makes the convergence of the inversions very robust (data misfits of all methods are close to the target misfits) and that final results are always close to the true models independent of the parameter choices. Finally, the scheme is applied on real data sets from the Faroe-Shetland Basin to image a basaltic sequence and underlying structures. The presence of a borehole and a 3-D reflection seismic survey in this region allows direct comparison and, hence, evaluate the quality of the joint inversion results. The results from joint inversion are more consistent with results from other studies than the ones from the corresponding individual inversions and the shape of the basaltic sequence is better resolved. However, due to the limited resolution of the individual methods used it was not possible to resolve structures underneath the basalt in detail, indicating that additional geophysical information (e.g. CSEM, reflection onsets) needs to be included.},

  abstract = {Well-log data are processed in order to derive subsurface physical parameters, namely rock porosity, fluid saturations and permeability. This step involves the selection and inversion of experimental constitutive equations, which are the link between the rock parameters and geophysical measurements. In this paper we investigate the rock parameter observability and the reliability of well-log data processing. We present a visual analysis of the constitutive equations and of the inverse problem conditioning, when using independently, or jointly, log data from different domains. The existence of a common set of rock properties (cross-properties) that influence different measurements, makes it possible to reduce the ambiguities of the interpretation. We select a test case in a reservoir scenario and we explore how to determine rock porosity and fluid saturation from sonic, conductivity and density logs. We propose a Bayesian joint inversion procedure, which is able to control the conditioning problems, to efficiently take into account input data and model uncertainty and to provide a confidence interval for the solution. The inversion procedure is validated on a real well-log data set.},
